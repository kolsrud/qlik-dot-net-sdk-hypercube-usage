# qlik-dot-net-sdk-hypercube-usage

This example illustrates how to work with hypercubes in a C# environment through the Qlik Sense .Net SDK. It illustrates among other things the following concepts:

* Definitions of dimensions and measures (both inlined and library)
* Cell formatting
* Sorting
* Selection
* Grouped dimensions
* Paging
* Use of multiple hypercubes in single object

This example currently only illustrates cubes using straight tables (no stacked or pivot tables).
